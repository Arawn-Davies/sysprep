# sysprep
My personal dev-environment setup script for Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux systems with the APT package manager  
  
Auto installs packages like GCC, binutils, gdb, NASM, texinfo, flex, bison, make, build-essential for C/C++ development  
(e.g, cross-compiling i686-elf or PlayStation 2 Dev)  
  
Like with my quick i686 compiler deployment script, you can run this with one line using   
```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arawn-Davies/sysprep/master/runme.sh && chmod +x runme.sh && ./runme.sh```
