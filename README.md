# sysprep
Quickly personalize + customize an Ubuntu/Linux system  

some of my .files, also eventually including quick setup   
util for debian-repository distros

like with my quick i686 compiler deployment script, you can run this with one line using   
```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arawn-Davies/sysprep/master/runme.sh && chmod +x runme.sh && ./runme.sh```
